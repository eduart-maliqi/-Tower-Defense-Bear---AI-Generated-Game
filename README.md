# 🐻 Tower Defense Bear - AI-Generated Game

A Tower Defense game that was almost entirely developed by AI. This project is an experiment to see how far you can get with AI-assisted development.

## 📖 About the Project

I wanted to test whether you can create a functional game using almost only AI - and here's the result! From architecture to implementation to gameplay, most of it was generated by AI tools. I mainly provided the ideas, and the AI wrote the code.

**⚠️ Important:** This is a learning project and experiment. The code isn't perfect and doesn't always follow best practices. But it works!(most of the time)

## 🎮 Features

- **Classic Tower Defense Gameplay**
  - 21 different towers with unique abilities
  - BTD6-inspired upgrade system with 3 upgrade paths
  - 5 different maps with varying themes and difficulty levels
  - Dynamic difficulty settings (Easy, Normal, Hard)

- **Champion System**
  - 4 special champions with unique abilities
  - Active and passive champion abilities
  - Champion abilities with cooldowns and strategic depth

- **Progression System**
  - Gold and Gems as currencies
  - Bear Knowledge System (permanent upgrades)
  - Map progress and detailed statistics
  - Persistent cloud storage

- **Firebase Integration**
  - User Authentication (Google, Email/Password, Guest Mode)
  - Cloud Firestore database
  - Real-time game progress synchronization
  - Admin system for management

- **Optimizations**
  - Offscreen Canvas Rendering with caching
  - Performance-optimized game loop
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - Sound system with map-specific music


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)


### Installation

#### Just to Play 
Open this website: [https://bears-tower-defense.web.app/](https://bears-tower-defense.web.app/)

#### For Developers
 
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduart-maliqi/-Tower-Defense-Bear---AI-Generated-Game.git
cd -Tower-Defense-Bear---AI-Generated-Game
```

2. Configure Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
   - Copy your Firebase config into `firebase-init.js`
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore

3. Deploy to Firebase Hosting (optional):
```bash
firebase deploy
```

4. Or run locally:

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, CSS3
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting
- **Development:** Mostly AI-generated 🤖 (GitHub Copilot, Claude)
- **Performance:** Offscreen Canvas, Request Animation Frame Loop

## 🤖 AI Development

**Almost all of the code** in this project was generated by AI tools:
- **Main tools:** GitHub Copilot, Claude (Anthropic)
- **My contribution:**
  - Providing ideas and concepts
  - Describing and designing features
  - Testing, debugging, and integrating code
  - Code cleanup (~2000 lines of duplicates removed)

The goal was to see how effectively you can develop a complete game with AI - and I'm surprised how well it worked!

## 🧹 Code Quality

- **Codebase:** ~10,000+ lines of JavaScript
- **Cleanup:** ~2000 lines of duplicates removed
- **Optimizations:** Rendering cache, performance system
- **Modular structure:** Separate systems for better maintainability

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Performance may slightly decrease with 100+ enemies on screen
- Mobile touch controls not yet fully optimized
- Sound system doesn't work 100% yet (browser autoplay policies)
- Some edge cases in pathfinding when switching maps
- Code quality varies (it's AI-generated after all 😅)

## 🎨 Credits

- **Development:** Mainly AI (Claude, GitHub Copilot) + my guidance
- **Game Design:** Inspired by Bloons TD6
- **Sounds:** Free sound libraries
- **Concept & Testing:** Eduart Maliqi
